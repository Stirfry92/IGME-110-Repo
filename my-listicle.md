# My Happy Little Listicle

A conjoined list of simple things that give me joy: sorted by category.
If I'm having a bad day throw this back in my face so I'm forced to be positive. No excuses... I *have* to be positive.

## Silly Creatures
A ton of wonderful animals make me happy, here are the top contributers:
### Bears
- Literally my spirit animal
- Basically giant lazy dogs **(BUT BETTER)**
- Absolutely magestic
### Cats
- I have three wonderful cats at home.
- My favorite pet, easy mantinence and endless love.
- They think we're equals (we are not).
### Dogs 
- Classic: Man's best friend.
- Loyalty is beautiful.
- Dogs do what humans ought to do: they are forever heroes.
### Birds (Of all kinds!)
- I genuinely enjoy bird watching.
- I always find bird ornaments beautiful and perfect for holiday decorations.
- I grew up near Rodger Tory Peterson's bird sanctuary, and I think that alone has shaped my brain to be fascinated by the little guys.
