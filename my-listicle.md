# My Happy Little Listicle

Some conjoined lists of simple things that give me joy.
If I'm having a bad day throw this listicle back in my face so I'm forced to be positive. No excuses... I *have* to be positive.

## Silly Creatures
A ton of wonderful animals make me happy, here are the top contributers:
### Bears
- Literally is my spirit animal.
- Basically giant lazy dogs **(BUT BETTER!)**
- Absolutely magestic.
### Cats
- I have three wonderful cats at home.
- My favorite pet, easy mantinence and endless love.
- They think we're equals (we are not).
### Dogs 
- Classic: Man's best friend.
- Loyalty is beautiful.
- Dogs do what humans ought to do: they are forever heroes.
### Birds (Of all kinds!)
- I genuinely enjoy bird watching.
- I always have found bird ornaments beautiful and perfect for holiday decorations.
- I grew up near [Rodger Tory Peterson's bird sanctuary](https://rtpi.org/), and I think that alone has shaped my brain to be fascinated by the little guys.

## Epic Videogames
There are tons of videogames that have shaped me as a person and bring positivity to my life. The following are a list of five steam games **I highly recommend** along with links to their steam page for those who have not checked them out yet! They are all **must buys.** Please check out their links in the list at the end of this section, if you have not played one of these and enjoy video games, it will be worth it.
### Red Dead Redemption 2
- Red Dead Redemption 2 might be the reason why I am confident video game development is the perfect place for me.
- The story is deep, nuanced, and beautiful. The gameplay reinforces the story elements and grounds you as the player into it's world in characters unlike any other game I've seen.
- Gameplay is stale after a while, but the game keeps players invested with incredible dialogue, voice acting, and even humor!
- Do keep in mind the game is rated M for mature, so not for a younger audience.
### Inscryption
- One of my favorite games to play blind, I had no idea what I was getting into and oh boy did it pay off.
- It is a puzzle solving, card game extravaganza with some ARG elements (if you are looking for them).
- It is mysterious, engaging, and borderline creepy when it surprises you.
- I don't wish to say too much about it as it is an experience best played blind, but if you are familiar with gaming as a whole, you will likely enjoy and be humored and amazed by this experience.
### Rain World
- This game is not for the faint of heart, it is difficult, frustrating, and even borderline unplayable in certain areas... **but that is the beauty!**
- The game uses intelligent AI enemies to create an entire alien ecosystem, which you are but a small part of.
- You are not at the top of the food chain, far from it. Every AI entity has its own goals and tasks to complete in each cycle before the rain comes, the spotlight is not on you.
- Unravel an expansive story as you progress slowly through this torturously hardcore platformer-2d-survival game, and eventually overcome and find peace.
- The music, art design, and story are all tied together so neatly... I am obssessed at how perfectly curated the experience is for what the developers were going for. If you can bare the struggle... you will enjoy this game and the hyper-fixated community that grew around it.
### The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition
- Skyrim is one of those games where you either grew up on it, or don't really have a particular interest in.
- Skyrim is not the most well polished game bethesda has produced... but there is so much content.
- The gameplay is extremely repetitive, and if you're trying to take the world for it's complete immersion or seriousness you likely won't have any fun.
- Skyrim is a game that allows for so much exploration and messing around with broken mechanics that you can create your own fun for seemingly a limitless amount of time.
- Skyrim also has a rich modding community, which also does not take itself seriously. Even now as I play through the default game, I still discover new locations, npcs, and other interesting objects throughout the map, which is so large it is nearly impossible to 100%.
### Celeste
- Difficult but extremely rewarding.
- Once again, I'm a huge fan of very curated experiences. Celeste has near perfect themeing, artstyle, and gameplay.
- The whole story is about overcoming adversity and feelings of doubt, and the literal gameplay is about climbing a mountain (Is that figurative of something? You bet!)
- Level design is incredible, and if you struggle with platformers like I do will take quite some time. The end is satisfying and worth it.
- This game *might* cure imposter syndrome... not sure but it might.

## Incredible People
There are some awesome people in my life that always keep me positive, every time I think of them my day get's a little bit brighter. Here is a few!
### My Older Brothers
- They act almost exactly like me. Weirdly so in a lot of circumstances.
- Huge inspiration for me. Since we're so similar I tend to look at their lives and believe I can reach similar goals.
- This belief keeps me going, they are living proof that I have so much to look forward to!
### Friends from Chataqua
- I've got some incredible friends back at home and, now that college has started, all over the place!
- They have supported me through some of my toughest times, and as much as it hurts to be away from them I know they will continue to do so!
- Know me probably better than anyone else.
### My Lovely Mother
- Provides endless support.
- Also a very inspiring person. She does it all.
- Would not be here without her, so that's cool.

## Conclusion:
These lists are not all-encompassing, obviously there is a lot more in my life to bring me joy than these simple ideas. Sometimes life isn't all about the expansive joys provided by having your dream job, purchasing your first family home, or striking something off of your bucket list. Most of us spend the majority of our lives in a transitional period. In college for example, we aren't much of anything until we finally make connections with people or get "the big job". That does not mean we have nothing to look forward to. If you can maintain a childlike sense of wonder for the simple pleasures life brings such as seeing an animal you like, playing a game, or finally calling that influential person, you will always have something to look forward to.
